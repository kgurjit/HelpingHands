# Helping Hands

## Problem
> There are lot of things we buy, use and then get rid of them by throwing them in the garbage. Reducing solid waste is reducing the amount of trash that goes to landfills. Reduce, Reuse and Recycle are the most common methods to reduce landfill waste. One of the worst things about landfill   is that so much of the solid waste is still of value to many. So how can we find an easy way for people to recycle and reuse items, instead of trashing them?

## Solution
> An application that helps people to list reusable items that they no longer need so that someone can make good use of it. 

## Benefits
* Reduces landfill waste
* Allows people to save money
* Creates a sense of sharing
